        Weiner recently collapsed, and was hospitalized at Shaare Zedek Medical Center in serious condition. On Saturday 30<sup>th</sup> of December 2023, he passed away. 
        
        He was a man of kindness, deeds, and action, and who founded the <a href="https://www.chesedspot.org/modiin-ilit/chaverim/yedidim-28chaverim-in-israel29" target="_blank">Yedidim</a> & was active in the Chaverim organizations. <br><br>

        Arrived with the first rescuers in the <span class="tooltip">Be'eri Kibbutz massacre
        <span class="tooltiptext">THe 7<sup>th</sup> of October 2023, Simhat Torah Festival, the terrorist group Hamas, undercover of the UNRWA attaked Isarel, murder people in their home, rape, burn babies in hoven, make more than 200 people as hostages. </span>
        </span>, he collapsed with a broken heart. <br>
        Too many atrocities! <br>
        Witnessing a burned baby in Hoven, table covered with the Sinhat torah festival meal and nappes where terrosists from Hamas have eaten and murdered the families. No words, but a broken heart. <br><br>

        Hospitalized at Shaare Zedek Medical Center, he survived for three months. Dying after multiple heart attacks. How a broken heart can survive such horrors? <br><br>

        Modi'in Illit, where he earned a living running the "Shehakol" store in Brachfeld. <br><br>
        When he began seeing civilians stranded on the roads with a flat tire, or trapped outside their home without a key, he founded the <a href="https://www.chesedspot.org/modiin-ilit/chaverim/yedidim-28chaverim-in-israel29" target="_blank">Yedidim</a> organization, through which many volunteers provide service 24 hours a day. <br><br>
