# A Circle can be defined by either specifying the radius or the diameter.
# The radius is the distance from the center of the circle to any point on its edge.
# If you have the diameter(d), you can find the radius with: r = d/2
# The diameter is the distance across the circle, passing through the center: d = 2*r
# The user can query the circle for either its radius or diameter. ok
# Other abilities of a Circle instance:
# Compute the circleâ€™s area:
# Print the attributes of the circle - use a dunder method
# Be able to add two circles together, and return a new circle with the new radius - use a dunder method
# Be able to compare two circles to see which is bigger, and return a Boolean - use a dunder method
# Be able to compare two circles and see if there are equal, and return a Boolean - use a dunder method
# Be able to put them in a list and sort them
# Bonus(not mandatory): Install the Turtle module, and draw the sorted circles
